# Reddit Keyword Monitor (Planned)

This project will use the Reddit API to monitor public posts from selected subreddits, detect posts containing specific keywords, and export structured data (title, snippet, date, subreddit, URL) for research purposes.

The app will:
- Read posts from selected public subreddits
- Filter posts based on predefined keywords/phrases
- Save structured data to an external system (CSV or Google Sheets)
- Not post, comment, vote, or message Redditors

Code will be written in Python using PRAW once API access is approved.
